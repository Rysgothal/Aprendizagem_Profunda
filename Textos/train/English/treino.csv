"Depending on the particular context, the term ""natural"" might also be distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural.",English
[12] The moon formed roughly 20 million years later.,English
"The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science.",English
"Despite the wide regional variations in climate by latitude and other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods,[9] and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on the ecological balance, and on the actual geography of the Earth.",English
Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions.,English
71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans.,English
"[1] The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or ""essential qualities, innate disposition"", and in ancient times, literally meant ""birth"".",English
The geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.,English
"The atmospheric conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life-forms,[8] which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions.",English
"Deposition can occur when sediments settle onto the surface of the Earth and later lithify into sedimentary rock, or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows, blanket the surface.",English
"[5][6] With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention : it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx).",English
"[1] Within the various uses of the word today, ""nature"" often refers to geology and wildlife.",English
"Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.",English
"This more traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind.",English
"These structural regimes broadly relate to convergent boundaries, divergent boundaries, and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates.",English

"It is often taken to mean the ""natural environment"" or wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention.",English
"This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase.",English
"Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, horizontal extension, or side-to-side (strike-slip) motion.",English
"Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, material world or universe.",English
"The field of geology encompasses the study of the composition, structure, physical properties, dynamics, and history of Earth materials, and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed.",English
"After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be deformed and/or metamorphosed.",English
"The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field.",English
